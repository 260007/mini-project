# Requirements

## Introduction
A fully featured Mensuration calculator which involves functions to calculate various mensuration parameters of almost all basic 2D and 3D shapes.
The Mensuration calculator program is written in C language with proper testing cases and makefile.

## Research
Design engineering , manufacturing industries, Gardening applications always require basic calculations such as perimeter area of 2D shapes and Curved surface area , Total Surface area of 3D shapes. Keeping these requirments in mind this project will help people and institutions for handy and accurate calculations. 

### Features

 - *PERIMETER* : Calculates perimeter of basic 2D shapes.
 - *AREA* : Calculates area of basic 2D shapes.
 - *CURVED SURFACE AREA* :Calculates curved surface area of 3D shapes.
 - *TOTAL SURFACE AREA* :Calculates total surface area of 3D shapes.
 - *VOLUME* : Calculates volume of 3D shapes.
 
# Defining the system

The system mainly involves eleven functions. That includes almost all basic 2D and 3D shapes. All the functions return values depending on choices selected by user.

# 4 W's and 1 H
### WHO 
 The project can be used almost by all institutions(manufacturing,school) where calculation related to mensuration are required. All the design employees and students can use the program to find out the answer they need.
### WHAT
Calculations related to basic mensuration can be calculated quickly. All the basics functionalities are included in the project. User can use the program efficiently and get the required results.

### WHEN
The project can be used at the time of solving the mensuration calculations 
and get the results for related problems. The result will be obtained quickly.

### WHERE
In all the domains where calculations related to measurements it can be used. As the project is portable and user-friendly, it can be easily implemented on the mobile systems and design annd manufacturing companies. It should overcome all the drawbacks of the Old existing system and most important of all meet the user requirements.

### HOW
System design is a solution for “HOW TO” approach to the creation of a new system. It translates system requirements into ways by which they can be made operational. It is a translational from a user oriented document to a document oriented programmers. For that, it provides the understanding and procedural details necessary for the implementation. Here UML diagrams are used to supplement the working of the new system. The system thus made should be reliable, durable and above all should have least possible maintenance costs.
